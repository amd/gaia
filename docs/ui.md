# GAIA UI (RAUX) Interface

**GAIA UI (also referred to as RAUX for RyzenAI User Experience)** is a modern Electron-based desktop application that provides the primary interface for GAIA. Built as a fork from [Open-WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui), it delivers an extensible, feature-rich, and user-friendly AI platform experience. GAIA UI is actively developed with regular feature updates and improvements.

## New in GAIA UI (RAUX)
- Improved error handling and progress reporting via inter-process communication (IPC) between the main and renderer processes.
- Unified GAIA UI branding and updated messaging throughout the installer and UI.
