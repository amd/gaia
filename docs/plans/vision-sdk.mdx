# Vision SDK - Document Processing Pipeline

<Info>
**Status:** Planning
**Timeline:** Q2-Q3 2026
[Vote with 👍](https://github.com/amd/gaia/issues/325)
</Info>

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive Vision Pipeline SDK for document processing, OCR, and structured data extraction. Consolidates fragmented vision capabilities across GAIA into a unified, developer-friendly API.

**Value:** Transform any document (medical forms, legal logs, technical manuals) into structured, searchable data using VLM-powered OCR—100% locally on AMD hardware.

**Impact:** Reduce vision agent code by 60%, enable document automation workflows, power legal/medical/technical document processing.

---

## The Problem

### Fragmented Vision Capabilities

**Current state:**
- Image processing duplicated across agents (EMR has 400+ lines of boilerplate)
- No unified document processing API
- Vision capabilities scattered across `llm/`, `vlm/`, `rag/`, `utils/`
- Each agent reimplements the same patterns

**Missing features:**
- No multi-page document processing
- No table extraction from documents
- No visual element extraction (charts, timelines)
- No structured extraction with flexible schemas
- No seamless RAG integration

**Impact:**
- Developers write 400+ lines for basic vision tasks
- Cannot process large legal documents (1,200+ pages)
- Technical manuals require manual preprocessing for RAG
- Each vision agent starts from scratch

---

## The Solution

### Vision SDK - One API for All Documents

```python
from gaia.vision import VisionSDK, ExtractionSchema

vision = VisionSDK()

# Medical forms → structured data
result = vision.extract("form.pdf", schema=medical_schema)

# Legal logs → text + tables + visuals
result = vision.extract("logs.pdf", extract_tables=True, extract_visuals=True)

# Technical manuals → RAG indexing
result = vision.extract("manual.pdf", pages="all")
```

**Key capabilities:**
- Multi-page processing (1 to 1,200+ pages)
- Table and visual element extraction
- **Handwriting recognition** (validated, production-ready)
- Structured data with flexible schemas
- Batch processing and multi-document detection
- Seamless RAG integration
- Agent mixin for vision-powered tools
- Production-ready with checkpointing and parallel processing

---

## Use Cases

### Medical Forms (EMR Agent)
Extract patient data from intake forms with validation.

```python
from gaia.vision import VisionSDK, ExtractionSchema

schema = ExtractionSchema.from_dict({
    "required": ["first_name", "last_name"],
    "fields": {
        "date_of_birth": {"type": "date"},
        "allergies": {"type": "string", "critical": True},
    },
    "allow_additional": True,
})

vision = VisionSDK()
result = vision.extract("intake_form.pdf", schema=schema)
```

**Impact:** EMR agent code reduces from 1,500 → 600 lines (60% reduction)

---

### Legal Compliance (Driver Logs)
Process multi-page driver logs with timeline charts and violation detection.

```python
vision = VisionSDK()

result = vision.extract(
    "driver_logs.pdf",
    pages="all",  # 1,200 pages
    extract_tables=True,
    extract_visuals=True,
    on_progress=callback,
)

# Access timeline charts
for page in result.pages:
    for visual in page.visuals:
        if visual.type == "timeline":
            print(visual.data)
```

**Impact:** Automate $$$+ legal expert analysis work

---

### Technical Manuals (RAG Q&A)
Index operations manuals for accurate Q&A.

```python
from gaia.vision import VisionSDK
from gaia.rag import RAGSDK

# Extract with tables
vision = VisionSDK()
doc = vision.extract("manual.pdf", pages="all", extract_tables=True)

# Index with RAG
rag = RAGSDK()
rag.add_document(doc.to_markdown())

# Query
answer = rag.query("What are the safety procedures?")
```

**Impact:** Enable precise answers from complex technical documents

---

### Batch Receipts (Expense Automation)
Process multiple receipts and generate expense reports.

```python
vision = VisionSDK()

# Batch process receipts
results = vision.extract_batch(
    files=["receipt1.jpg", "receipt2.jpg", ...],
    schema=receipt_schema,
)

# Export as expense report
results.to_excel("expenses.xlsx")

# Or single image with multiple receipts
result = vision.extract(
    "three_receipts.jpg",
    detect_multiple=True,  # Detect 3 receipts in one image
    schema=receipt_schema,
)
```

**Impact:** Expense reporting automation, receipt digitization

---

### Business Cards (CRM Integration)
Extract contact information for CRM import.

```python
vision = VisionSDK()

result = vision.extract("business_card.jpg", schema=contact_schema)

# Export to VCF/CSV
result.to_vcard("contact.vcf")
# Fields: name, title, company, email, phone, linkedin
```

**Impact:** Networking automation, contact management

---

### ID Cards (KYC Compliance)
Identity verification for compliance and onboarding.

```python
vision = VisionSDK()

result = vision.extract(
    "drivers_license.jpg",
    schema=id_card_schema,
    detect_face=True,  # Face detection
)

# Validate
age = calculate_age(result.data["date_of_birth"])
is_valid = result.data["expiration_date"] > today()
```

**Impact:** KYC automation, age verification, identity fraud prevention

---

### Bank Statements (Financial Analysis)
Extract transactions for accounting and reconciliation.

```python
vision = VisionSDK()

result = vision.extract(
    "bank_statement.pdf",
    pages="all",
    extract_tables=True,
)

# Transaction table
transactions = result.tables[0].to_dataframe()
transactions.to_csv("transactions.csv")
```

**Impact:** Accounting automation, expense tracking, reconciliation

---

### Handwritten Forms & Notes
Digitize handwritten content with high accuracy.

```python
vision = VisionSDK()

# Handwritten meeting notes
result = vision.extract(
    "meeting_notes.jpg",
    handwriting_mode=True,  # Optimized for handwriting
)

# Filled forms (mixed print + handwriting)
result = vision.extract(
    "filled_application.pdf",
    schema=application_schema,
    handwriting_mode=True,
)
```

**Impact:** Form digitization, note-taking automation, historical document preservation

<Note>
**Validated:** VLM handwriting recognition performs well on real-world forms. Included as core capability.
