# GAIA v0.15.3.2 Release Notes

**Patch release** fixing package registration issues that caused `ModuleNotFoundError` on non-editable installs, plus CI reliability improvements and bug fixes.

---

## 🎯 Key Changes

### Package Registration Fixes

Fixed `ModuleNotFoundError` errors that occurred when GAIA was installed via `pip install` (non-editable mode). These packages existed on disk but weren't registered in `setup.py`:

- `gaia.vlm` - Vision Language Model support
- `gaia.apps.docker` - Docker application
- `gaia.apps.jira` - Jira application
- `gaia.apps.summarize.templates` - Summarization templates
- `gaia.eval.fix_code_testbench` - Code fix evaluation testbench

Also created missing `__init__.py` files for:
- `gaia.mcp` - MCP protocol module
- `gaia.eval` - Evaluation framework
- `gaia.talk` - Voice interaction
- `gaia.apps.summarize` - Summarization app

### Entry Point Fixes

- **Fixed `gaia-mcp` command**: Added missing `main()` function to `mcp_bridge.py` so the console script entry point works
- **Removed broken entry point**: Deleted `gaia-mcp-atlassian` entry point that referenced a non-existent file

### Improved `gaia init` Flow

Previously, if a user answered 'n' to installing Lemonade, the init wizard would stop at step 1/4. Now it continues to step 2 (server health check) which properly verifies connectivity regardless of setup method:

- Remote server via `LEMONADE_BASE_URL` environment variable
- Manual local installation
- Pre-existing installation

The health check is now the proper gate for determining server availability, not the installation prompt.

## 🔧 CI/CD Improvements

### Fixed Release Notes Race Condition

The `pypi.yml` workflow was overwriting release notes with an empty string when `publish_installer.yml` had already created the GitHub release. Now it checks if the release exists first and only creates as a fallback with `--generate-notes`.

### New Packaging Integrity Tests

Added `test_packaging.py` with 6 comprehensive tests to catch packaging issues in CI:

1. All filesystem packages are registered in `setup.py`
2. All `setup.py` packages exist on disk
3. All packages have `__init__.py` files
4. Entry point modules exist on disk
5. Entry point functions exist in source code
6. Entry point parent packages are declared

### Lint Configuration Updates

Re-enabled 13 pylint checks that were previously disabled, after fixing all violations in:
- `eval.py`, `groundtruth.py`, `batch_experiment.py`
- All MCP module files (`agent_mcp_server.py`, `blender_mcp_server.py`, `mcp_bridge.py`, etc.)

---

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed flaky Chat SDK memory test by removing system prompt instruction that confused small models
- Fixed unused variable warnings in `batch_experiment.py`
- Fixed f-strings without interpolation in `batch_experiment.py`
- Fixed trailing whitespace and encoding issues in `eval.py`
- Removed dead `ChatApp` import from `agents/__init__.py`
