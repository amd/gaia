# Glossary

This glossary defines technical terms, acronyms, and concepts used throughout the GAIA documentation. Terms are organized alphabetically for easy reference.

---

## A

### Activation Script
A shell script that activates a Python virtual environment, making its packages available in the current terminal session.

### Agent
An AI system that can autonomously plan, reason, and use tools to accomplish tasks. In GAIA, agents extend the base `Agent` class, register tools via `_register_tools()`, and follow an iterative loop: think about the task, act by calling tools, observe results, and reason about next steps. Built-in agents include ChatAgent, CodeAgent, JiraAgent, and BlenderAgent. See also: Agent Loop, Tool, Mixin.

### Agent Loop
The cyclic process an agent follows: thinking about the task, acting by calling tools, observing the results, and reasoning about next steps.

### Agent State
The current phase of agent processing, such as planning, executing, error recovery, or completion.

### AgentConsole
GAIA's colorful command-line interface that provides formatted output for agent operations, making it easier to follow agent reasoning.

### Agentic RAG
Retrieval-Augmented Generation with multi-step reasoning capabilities, where the agent can iteratively refine queries and synthesize information from multiple sources. Unlike traditional RAG (one search, one answer), Agentic RAG can make multiple retrieval calls, refine queries based on initial results, and know when documents don't contain the needed information.
