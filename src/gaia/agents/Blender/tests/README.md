# Blender Agent Tests

This directory contains tests for the Blender Agent, including both unit tests and integration tests.

## Running Tests

### Unit Tests

To run unit tests only:

```bash
pytest -xvs src/gaia/agents/Blender/tests/test_agent_v1.py -k "not integration"
```

### Integration Tests

Integration tests require a running MCP server (Blender with the MCP add-on). Before running integration tests:

1. Start Blender with the MCP add-on enabled
2. Ensure the MCP server is running on port 9876

Then run:

```bash
pytest -xvs src/gaia/agents/Blender/tests/test_agent_v1.py -k "integration"
```

Integration tests will automatically be skipped if the MCP server is not running.

### All Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
pytest -xvs src/gaia/agents/Blender/tests/test_agent_v1.py
```

To skip integration tests regardless of whether MCP server is running:

```bash
pytest -xvs src/gaia/agents/Blender/tests/test_agent_v1.py --skip-integration
```

## Test Structure

- `test_agent_v1.py` - Tests for the BlenderAgentSimple class
- `conftest.py` - Pytest fixtures and configuration
- `test_mcp_client.py` - Tests for the MCPClient
- `test_mcp.py` - Lower-level MCP tests

## Integration Test Notes

Integration tests are marked with the `@pytest.mark.integration` decorator and require a running MCP server. The tests use a real LLMClient with a special system prompt that provides predictable responses for testing purposes.

For example, when asked to create a cube, the LLM will always respond with `CUBE,1,2,3,0.5,1,1.5`, which allows us to make assertions about the expected result.
