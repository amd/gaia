# Suppress false positive for claude.yml workflow
# The pull_request_target + checkout pattern is flagged as dangerous, but our workflow is safe because:
# 1. We only checkout PR code for Claude to READ (not execute)
# 2. No build/install steps that would execute PR code (npm install, pip install, make, etc.)
# 3. Claude only reads files and posts review comments
# See: .github/workflows/claude.yml lines 9-15 for full security documentation
