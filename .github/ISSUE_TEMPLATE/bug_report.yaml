        ## Thank You! ðŸ™Œ
        
        Your feedback helps make GAIA better for everyone! We'll look into this as soon as we can.
        
        The more details you can share, the better we can help, but don't worry if you can't provide everything.
        Key things that often help us investigate:
        - Steps to reproduce what you're seeing
        - Any error messages or logs
        - Your hardware and software setup
        - Driver versions (if using NPU or GPU features)
        
        Feel free to check our [README.md](https://github.com/amd/gaia/blob/main/README.md) and [FAQ.md](https://github.com/amd/gaia/blob/main/FAQ.md) while you wait for a response.
        
        We appreciate your help in improving GAIA! ðŸ’«
