# Changelog — `gaia-agent-email`

All notable changes to the GAIA Email Triage agent package are recorded here.
Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); the REST
contract version is tracked separately as
`gaia_agent_email.contract.SCHEMA_VERSION` (see `CONTRACT.md`).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`list_connected_mailboxes` tool — the agent can report live mailbox
  connection state (#2401).** "Which mailbox are you connected to?" now names
  the actual connected account(s) instead of paraphrasing the system prompt's
  capability text, and with nothing connected the agent says so plainly and
  points to Settings → Connectors. State is resolved live per call (via
  `available_mailbox_providers()` + `get_connection`), so a disconnect →
  reconnect made without restarting GAIA is reflected on the next question.
  The reactive fail-loud errors on mailbox *operations* are unchanged.

### Fixed

- **IMPORTANT / account-security mail is never auto-archived unattended (#2426).**
  At autonomy `full`, one cycle could auto-archive a provider-flagged IMPORTANT
  message (e.g. a Google security alert) the local model mislabeled as promotional.
  `TrustPolicy.decide` now applies a one-directional floor: an `archive` candidate
  that is Gmail-`IMPORTANT` / Outlook high-importance, or from a narrow set of
  account-security senders, is downgraded to a proposal at every level — a higher
  level or earned trust can widen what runs silently but can never override it.
  Ordinary promotional clutter still auto-archives.
- **Re-proposal dedup survives headless/scheduled teardown (#2381).**
  `record_proposal` wrote its dedup row through `query()`, which never commits,
  so when the scheduler rebuilt the agent between fires (closing the DB
  connection) the row was lost and the same still-in-inbox message was proposed
  again on every fire. The INSERT is now committed via `db.transaction()`, so a
  proposal recorded on one connection is visible after teardown/rebuild — matching
  the commit discipline already used by `record_outcome` and `record_autonomy_action`.

### Changed

- **Daemon-supervised scheduling (V2-15, #2156).** When the GAIA daemon spawns
  the sidecar it sets `GAIA_DAEMON_SUPERVISED=1`; in that mode the sidecar's two
  embedded clocks — the daily `BriefingScheduler` (#1918) and the one-shot
  `EmailJobScheduler` polling thread (#1919) — no longer start. The daemon owns
  a single reconciled clock and drives those jobs itself, so a scheduled brief
  or send now fires even with the web UI and CLI closed, and can no longer be
  silently killed when an idle sidecar is reaped.

  This is **additive and gated by supervision context, not a deletion**: a
  standalone `gaia-agent-email serve`, a bare integrator, or a
  `CustodyProvider` deployment never sees the env var and keeps both embedded
  clocks live exactly as before. The frozen `/v1/email/*` REST contract and
  `SCHEMA_VERSION` are unchanged.

### Added

- **Full autonomy — earn-trust engine + observe→decide→act loop (#1115, #557,
  #1483, #1287, #2005).** Set `autonomy_level` to `earn_trust` and the agent
  handles low-signal mail on its own: each heartbeat (`on_heartbeat` /
  `run_autonomy_cycle`) triages the inbox and either archives a message silently
  — where your explicit preferences sanction it, or its sender/category has crossed
  the trust bar in the ledger — or files a proposal for approval. Cautious on day one.
  - **The destructive floor always asks.** Send, forward, permanent-delete,
    RSVP, and quarantine require confirmation at *every* level, even for a
    fully-trusted sender — a parity test locks the policy floor to the agent's
    real `CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED_TOOLS`. Only reversible actions auto-execute,
    each with undo via `action_store`.
  - **It learns from your corrections.** `record_autonomy_outcome` is the single
    funnel every trust signal flows through; undoing an auto-archive (through the
    real `undo_archive_batch` tool) is captured automatically as a negative outcome
    and pulls trust back below the bar, updating both the sender and the category
    scope from one choice. Positive-outcome accrual — trust *rising* as suggestions
    are accepted or left standing — is not yet wired, so today the ledger only
    ratchets trust down.
  - **Inspectable, never a black box.** `autonomy_status()` and
    `GET /v1/email/agent/autonomy/{session_id}` expose the level, thresholds,
    and every earned-trust scope with its tally. `POST /v1/email/agent/autonomy`
    sets the level (pause / resume / `off` kill switch); `POST …/autonomy/run`
    triggers one cycle. Config knobs: `autonomy_level`,
    `autonomy_trust_min_samples`, `autonomy_trust_threshold`.
  - **Runs on a schedule.** `AutonomyScheduler` + `run_autonomy_job`
    (`autonomy_scheduler.py`) drive the cycle on an interval — off by default,
    opt in with `GAIA_EMAIL_AUTONOMY_ENABLED=true` (`…_LEVEL`, `…_INTERVAL_MINUTES`,
    `…_MAX_MESSAGES`). Mirrors the briefing scheduler and is gated off under
    daemon supervision, where the daemon's single clock drives `run_autonomy_job`
    instead — no second scheduler.
- `gaia_agent_email.supervision.is_daemon_supervised()` — detects the daemon
  supervision handshake (the env-var name is owned by core in
  `gaia.daemon.constants`, so daemon and sidecar can never drift).
- `gaia_agent_email.daemon_migration` — adapter that lifts the embedded clocks'
  jobs (pending `schedule_store` one-shots + the enabled daily briefing) into
  the daemon clock **exactly once** via the core reconciler's migration ledger,
  and asserts no job is silently dropped in the process.
