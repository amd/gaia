**GAIA is an open-source solution designed for the quick setup and execution of generative AI applications on local PC hardware.** It enables fast and efficient execution of LLM-based applications using a hybrid hardware approach that combines the AMD Neural Processing Unit (NPU) and Integrated Graphics Processing Unit (iGPU) in the Ryzen-AI PC. GAIA provides the following key features:

**Currently supports Windows 11 Home/Pro**

- üè† **Local LLM Processing**: Easily run powerful language models directly on your Windows device without cloud dependencies
- üéØ **Multiple Use Cases**: From basic chat to RAG-enhanced applications and specialized agents
- ‚ö° **Optimized Performance**: Leverages the AMD NPU and iGPU for hybrid acceleration to get fast and efficient AI processing
- üñ•Ô∏è **Easy-to-Use Interface**: Provides both a command-line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI) option for easy interaction with models and agents
- üîß **Extensible Architecture**: Easily build and integrate your own agents and use cases
- üîÑ **Multiple Installation Modes**: GAIA can be installed in three modes:
   - **Hybrid Mode**: Optimized for Ryzen AI PCs, combining AMD Neural Processing Unit (NPU) and Integrated Graphics Processing Unit (iGPU) for maximum performance
   - **NPU Mode**: Optimized for power efficiency, using only the NPU (coming soo)
   - **Generic Mode**: Compatible with any Windows PC, using Ollama as the backend

For more details, see our [GAIA Blog Article](https://www.amd.com/en/developer/resources/technical-articles/gaia-an-open-source-project-from-amd-for-running-local-llms-on-ryzen-ai.html) or [Frequently Asked Questions](docs/faq.md).
For Ryzen AI LLM app development similar to GAIA, see [this developer guide](https://ryzenai.docs.amd.com/en/latest/llm/overview.html).

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: GAIA's Hybrid mode **only supports AMD Ryzen AI HX 300 series or newer processors**. For older AMD processors or non-AMD systems, the installer will install the generic mode with ollama. For more details, see [here](https://www.amd.com/en/products/software/ryzen-ai-software.html#tabs-2733982b05-item-7720bb7a69-tab).

# Getting Started Guide

The quickest way to get started with GAIA is by using our unified installer that supports all modes:

**gaia-windows-setup.exe**: A single installer that supports all three installation modes:
- **Hybrid Mode**: Offers best performance with NPU+iGPU on Ryzen AI processors, recommended option.
- **NPU Mode**: Optimized for power efficiency on Ryzen AI processors *(coming soon)*
- **Generic Mode**: Works on any Windows PC, using Ollama as the backend

The installer includes both a CLI tool and a GUI. The installation process typically takes about 5-10 minutes, depending on your Wi-Fi connection, and provides everything you need to start working with LLMs.

‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE**: When running GAIA using the Hybrid mode, please make sure to disable any discrete third-party GPUs in Device Manager.

## Installation Steps

![image](./data/img/gaia-setup.png)

To install the GAIA application, please follow these steps:
1. Make sure you meet the minimum [system requirements](#system-requirements) - **For Hybrid mode, you must have AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 300 or newer processor**
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/amd/gaia/releases) of the GAIA installer from the "Assets" section
1. Unzip the downloaded file and run the installer by double-clicking the .exe file.

   ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE**: If you get a Windows Security warning, you can verify the application by clicking *"More info"* and then *"Run anyway"*. This warning appears because the application is not digitally signed.

   ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE**: The installer will attempt to write to the same directory by default and may overwrite a previous installation of GAIA. Change the target directory if you want to avoid this.

1. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation:
   1. Choose your installation mode based on your hardware:
      - **Hybrid Mode**: Best performance, requires Ryzen AI processor
      - **NPU Mode**: Power-efficient, requires Ryzen AI processor *(coming soon)*
      - **Generic Mode**: Compatible with any PC
   1. The installer will automatically detect your CPU and only enable compatible modes
   1. The process takes about 5-10 minutes depending on your Wi-Fi connection

1. Once installation is complete, two desktop icons will be created.
   1. GAIA-CLI - Double click this icon to launch the CLI tool.
   1. GAIA-GUI - Double click this icon to launch the GUI tool.

### Command-line Installation

If you prefer to use the command-line or for CI/CD environments, you can run the installer with parameters:

```
gaia-windows-setup.exe /S /MODE=HYBRID
```

Available parameters:
- `/S` - Silent installation (no UI)
- `/MODE=X` - Set installation mode (GENERIC, NPU, or HYBRID)
- `/D=<path>` - Set installation directory (must be last parameter)

## Uninstallation Steps

‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE**: There is currently no automatic uninstaller available for GAIA, but one is coming soon. For now, you must manually remove GAIA from your system. Note that newer installations of GAIA will automatically remove older versions.

To completely uninstall GAIA from your system, follow these steps:

1. Close all running instances of GAIA (both CLI and GUI).

2. Remove the GAIA folder from AppData:
   1. Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog
   2. Type `%localappdata%` and press Enter
   3. Find and delete the `GAIA` folder

3. Remove model files from the cache folder:
   1. Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog
   2. Type `%userprofile%\.cache` and press Enter
   3. Delete any GAIA-related model folders (such as `huggingface` and `lemonade`)

4. Remove desktop shortcuts:
   1. Delete the GAIA-CLI and GAIA-GUI shortcuts from your desktop

## Running the GAIA GUI

Check your desktop for the GAIA-GUI icon and double-click it to launch the GUI. The first time you launch GAIA, it may take a few minutes to start. Subsequent launches will be faster. You may also need to download the latest LLM models from Hugging Face. GAIA will handle this automatically but may request a Hugging Face token for access. If you encounter any issues with model downloads or the GUI application, please refer to the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section or contact the [AMD GAIA team](mailto:gaia@amd.com).

## Running the GAIA CLI

To quickly get started with GAIA via the command line, you can use the GAIA CLI (`gaia-cli`) tool. Double click on the GAIA-CLI icon and run `gaia-cli -h` for help details. For more information and examples, please refer to the [gaia-cli documentation](docs/cli.md).

## Building from Source

To get started building from source, please follow the latest instructions [here](./docs/dev.md). These instructions will setup the [Onnx Runtime GenAI](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime-genai) through the [Lemonade Web Server](https://github.com/onnx/turnkeyml/blob/main/docs/lemonade/getting_started.md) tool targeting the Ryzen AI SoC.

‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE**: You may need to install Ollama from [here](https://ollama.com/download) if you plan to use GAIA in Generic mode and run models with the Ollama backend.
