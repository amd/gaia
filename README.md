```

The first time you run GAIA, it may take a few minutes to download and load models. Subsequent uses will be much faster.

### Command-Line Installation

If you prefer to use the command-line or for CI/CD environments, you can run the installer with parameters:

```
gaia-windows-setup.exe /S
```

Available parameters:
- `/S` - Silent installation (no UI)
- `/D=<path>` - Set installation directory (must be last parameter)

### Linux Installation

For Linux systems, GAIA provides both GUI and CLI support:

**GUI Installation:**
For GAIA UI (graphical interface) installation on Linux, see the [UI Documentation](docs/ui.md#ubuntu-deb) for detailed instructions including .deb package installation.

**CLI Installation from Source:**

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.10+
- pip package manager
- git

**Installation Steps:**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amd/gaia.git
   cd gaia
   ```

2. Install GAIA CLI:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. Install Lemonade server (for model serving):
   ```bash
   # Download and install Lemonade server
   # Visit https://www.lemonade-server.ai for latest Linux release
   # Or build from source following their documentation
   ```

4. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   gaia -v
   ```

**Note:** Both GUI (.deb packages) and CLI (source installation) are fully supported on Linux. 

## Uninstallation Steps

‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE**: There is currently no automatic uninstaller available for GAIA, but one is coming soon. For now, you must manually remove GAIA from your system. Note that newer installations of GAIA will automatically remove older versions.

To completely uninstall GAIA from your system, follow these steps:

1. Close all running instances of GAIA (both CLI and GUI).

2. Remove the GAIA folder from AppData:
   1. Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog
   2. Type `%localappdata%` and press Enter
   3. Find and delete the `GAIA` folder

3. Remove model files from the cache folder:
   1. Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog
   2. Type `%userprofile%\.cache` and press Enter
   3. Delete any GAIA-related model folders (such as `huggingface` and `lemonade`)

4. Remove desktop shortcuts:
   1. Delete the GAIA-CLI and GAIA-GUI shortcuts from your desktop

## Running the GAIA GUI

Check your desktop for the GAIA-GUI icon and double-click it to launch the GUI. The first time you launch GAIA, it may take a few minutes to start. Subsequent launches will be faster. You may also need to download the latest LLM models from Hugging Face. GAIA will handle this automatically but may request a Hugging Face token for access. If you encounter any issues with model downloads or the GUI application, please refer to the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section or contact the [AMD GAIA team](mailto:gaia@amd.com).

## Installing Lemonade Server (Required for CLI Commands)

Most GAIA CLI commands require the Lemonade server to be running. If you installed GAIA with the installer, Lemonade server should already be included. However, you can also install it separately:

### Option 1: Standalone Installation
1. Visit [www.lemonade-server.ai](https://www.lemonade-server.ai) to download the latest release
2. Download and install `Lemonade_Server_Installer.exe` from the latest release
3. Ensure your system has the recommended Ryzen AI drivers installed (NPU Driver `32.0.203.237` or `32.0.203.240`)
4. Launch the server by double-clicking the `lemonade_server` desktop shortcut created during installation

### Option 2: Already Included with GAIA Installer
If you installed GAIA using our unified installer, Lemonade server is already included. Simply:
1. Double-click the GAIA-CLI desktop shortcut
2. Run `lemonade-server serve` in the command prompt to start the server

**Note**: The Lemonade server provides OpenAI-compatible REST API endpoints and enables hybrid NPU/iGPU acceleration on Ryzen AI systems. For more details, see the [AMD Ryzen AI documentation](https://ryzenai.docs.amd.com/en/latest/llm/server_interface.html).

## Running the GAIA CLI

To quickly get started with GAIA via the command line, you can use the GAIA CLI (`gaia`) tool. Double click on the GAIA-CLI icon to launch the command-line shell with the GAIA environment activated, then run `gaia --help` for help details.

### Quick Start Examples

**Direct LLM Queries** (fastest option, no server management required):
```bash
gaia llm "What is artificial intelligence?"
gaia llm "Explain machine learning" --model llama3.2:3b --max-tokens 200
```

**Interactive Chat Sessions**:
```bash
gaia chat                        # Start text chat with default agent
gaia chat --agent-name Blender   # Chat with Blender agent for 3D tasks
```

**Single Prompts to Agents**:
```bash
gaia prompt "Create a red cube" --agent-name Blender
gaia prompt "What's the weather?" --stats
```

**Voice Interaction**:
```bash
gaia talk  # Start voice-based conversation
```

**3D Scene Creation with Blender Agent**:
```bash
gaia blender                                    # Run all Blender examples
gaia blender --interactive                      # Interactive 3D scene creation
gaia blender --query "Create a red cube and blue sphere"  # Custom 3D scene query
gaia blender --example 2                        # Run specific example
```

### Available Commands

- `llm` - Direct LLM queries (requires Lemonade server)
- `prompt` - Send single message to an agent
- `chat` - Interactive text conversation
- `talk` - Voice-based conversation
- `blender` - Create and modify 3D scenes using the Blender agent
- `stats` - View performance statistics
- `groundtruth` - Generate evaluation data with Claude
- `test` - Run audio/speech tests
- `youtube` - Download YouTube transcripts
- `kill` - Kill processes on specific ports

**Note**: Most commands require the Lemonade server to be running. Start it by double-clicking the desktop shortcut or running `lemonade-server serve`.

**Blender Command**: The `blender` command additionally requires a Blender MCP server. See [CLI documentation](docs/cli.md#blender-command) for setup instructions.

For comprehensive information and examples, please refer to the [gaia documentation](docs/cli.md).

## Building from Source

To get started building from source, please follow the latest instructions [here](./docs/dev.md). These instructions will setup the [Onnx Runtime GenAI](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime-genai) through the [Lemonade Server](https://lemonade-server.ai/) tool targeting the Ryzen AI SoC.


# Features

For a list of features and supported LLMs, please refer to the [Features](docs/features.md) page.

# Contributing

This is a new project with a codebase that is actively being developed. If you decide to contribute, please:
- Submit your contributions via a Pull Request.
