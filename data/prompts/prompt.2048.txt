Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient Northeast Africa. It was concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River, situated in the place that is now the country Egypt. Ancient Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3100 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology)[1] with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under Menes (often identified with Narmer).[2] The history of ancient Egypt unfolded as a series of stable kingdoms interspersed by periods of relative instability known as “Intermediate Periods.” The various kingdoms fall into one of three categories: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age, or the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age.Ancient Egypt reached the pinnacle of its power during the New Kingdom, ruling much of Nubia and a sizable portion of the Levant. After this period, it entered an era of slow decline. During the course of its history, Ancient Egypt was invaded or conquered by a number of foreign powers, including the Hyksos, the Nubians, the Assyrians, the Achaemenid Persians, and the Macedonians under Alexander the Great. The Greek Ptolemaic Kingdom, formed in the aftermath of Alexander's death, ruled until 30 BC, when, under Cleopatra, it fell to the Roman Empire and became a Roman province.[3] Egypt remained under Roman control until the 640s AD, when it was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate.The success of ancient Egyptian civilization came partly from its ability to adapt to the conditions of the Nile River valley for agriculture. The predictable flooding and controlled irrigation of the fertile valley produced surplus crops, which supported a more dense population, and social development and culture. With resources to spare, the administration sponsored mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions, the early development of an independent writing system, the organization of collective construction and agricultural projects, trade with surrounding regions, and a military intended to assert Egyptian dominance. Motivating and organizing these activities was a bureaucracy of elite scribes, religious leaders, and administrators under the control of a pharaoh, who ensured the cooperation and unity of the Egyptian people in the context of an elaborate system of religious beliefs.[4]The many achievements of the ancient Egyptians include the quarrying, surveying, and construction techniques that supported the building of monumental pyramids, temples, and obelisks; a system of mathematics, a practical and effective system of medicine, irrigation systems, and agricultural production techniques, the first known planked boats,[5] Egyptian faience and glass technology, new forms of literature, and the earliest known peace treaty, made with the Hittites.[6] Ancient Egypt has left a lasting legacy. Its art and architecture were widely copied, and its antiquities were carried off to far corners of the world. Its monumental ruins have inspired the imaginations of travelers and writers for millennia. A newfound respect for antiquities and excavations in the early modern period by Europeans and Egyptians has led to the scientific investigation of Egyptian civilization and a greater appreciation of its cultural legacy.[7]Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient Northeast Africa.

The predictable flooding and controlled irrigation of the fertile valley produced surplus crops, which supported a more dense population, and social development and culture. With resources to spare, the administration sponsored mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions, the early development of an independent party independent writing system, which became one of the earliest and most sophisticated scripts in human history. This hieroglyphic system, along with its cursive counterpart hieratic, enabled the ancient Egyptians to maintain detailed records of their administrative, religious, and literary achievements for over three millennia.  The Egyptian civilization's remarkable longevity was supported by its complex religious system, which permeated every aspect of daily life. The pharaoh, considered a living embodiment of the god Horus, served as both political leader and divine intermediary. This theological framework provided stability and continuity across generations, while also driving massive architectural and artistic undertakings in honor of both gods and rulers.  Their architectural achievements were particularly noteworthy, extending far beyond the famous pyramids. The Egyptians developed sophisticated engineering techniques that allowed them to construct massive temples, elaborate tomb complexes, and sprawling cities. These structures were built with incredible precision using simple but effective tools, demonstrating their advanced understanding of mathematics, geometry, and astronomy. The Great Pyramid of Giza, built around 2560 BCE, remained the tallest human-made structure in the world for over 3,800 years.  Egyptian influence on world culture cannot be overstated. Their artistic conventions influenced Greek and Roman art, while their architectural innovations inspired builders across the ancient world. Their medical knowledge, preserved in papyri like the Edwin Smith Papyrus, showed a remarkable understanding of human anatomy and practical treatments. Egyptian mathematics, including their advanced understanding of geometry and unit fractions, laid groundwork for later mathematical developments.  The civilization's impact on agriculture was equally significant. They developed sophisticated irrigation systems that transformed the Nile Valley into one of the ancient world's most productive agricultural regions. Their innovations included the shadoof (a counterbalanced water-lifting device), extensive canal networks, and advanced techniques for crop rotation and soil management. These agricultural advances supported a large population and enabled the development of specialized crafts and professions.  Trade was another cornerstone of Egyptian success. They established extensive trading networks reaching as far as Punt (possibly modern-day Somalia), the Levant, and Mesopotamia. These connections brought valuable resources like cedar wood from Lebanon, gold from Nubia, and exotic goods from across the known world. The Egyptians were also skilled diplomats, as evidenced by the aforementioned peace treaty with the Hittites, which stands as a testament to their diplomatic sophistication.  The civilization's decline was gradual, marked by periods of foreign rule that nevertheless saw Egyptian culture continue to exert significant influence. Even under Greek and Roman rule, Egyptian religious and cultural practices persisted, often blending with those of their conquerors to create unique syncretic traditions. This cultural resilience ensured that elements of ancient Egyptian civilization would continue to influence human society long after the last hieroglyphs were carved.  The rediscovery of ancient Egypt during the Renaissance, and particularly following Napoleon's expedition in 1798, sparked a worldwide fascination that continues to this day. Modern archeological discoveries continue to reveal new aspects of this remarkable civilization, demonstrating its complexity and sophistication while inspiring new generations to study and learn from its achievements. The Egyptian contribution to metallurgy and craftsmanship was equally remarkable. Their artisans developed sophisticated techniques for working with gold, copper, and later bronze, creating intricate jewelry and ceremonial objects that demonstrate exceptional skill. The discovery of King Tutankhamun's tomb in 1922 revealed the extraordinary level of craftsmanship achieved by Egyptian artisans, with items like his golden death mask becoming iconic symbols of ancient Egyptian artistry.  Egyptian cosmology and astronomy were highly developed, with priest-astronomers maintaining detailed observations of celestial bodies. They created one of the earliest known civil calendars, consisting of 365 days divided into 12 months of 30 days each, with five additional days at the end of the year. This calendar was so accurate that it remained in use into the Roman period and influenced the development of the Western calendar system.  The role of women in ancient Egypt was notably progressive for its time. While other ancient civilizations often restricted women's rights, Egyptian women could own property, conduct business, and even rule as pharaohs. The most famous example is Hatshepsut, who ruled as pharaoh for over twenty years during the New Kingdom period, overseeing a peaceful and prosperous era marked by ambitious building projects and successful trading expeditions.  Egyptian medicine was remarkably advanced, combining practical treatments with magical elements. Their physicians were specialists, with some focusing on specific areas of the body. They understood the concept of pulse and its relationship to the heart, developed numerous surgical procedures, and created an extensive pharmacopoeia using both mineral and plant-based ingredients. Many of their medical treatments were so effective that they continued to be used well into the medieval period.  The development of Egyptian literature encompassed various genres, from religious texts to love poetry, wisdom literature, and autobiographical inscriptions. The \"Instructions\" or \"Wisdom Texts\" genre, which provided moral and practical guidance, influenced similar literature throughout the ancient Near East. Works like the \"Tale of Sinuhe\" and the \"Story of Wenamun\" provide invaluable insights into a
